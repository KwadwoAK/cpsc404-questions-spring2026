## Question
Chapter 2 delves into the idea of delaying answering our managers because of the subconscious idea of the "Game of School" in which we may fear a wrong or incomplete answer may result in a bad grade or that asking for outside help is a form of cheating. This increases the amount of time it takes to reply to simple queries, reducing efficiency and productivity. How might realizing that managers are looking for help rather than evaluating your intellect change how you prioritize response time and what effect could that have on work efficiency. Additionally does this change in perspective also result in your communicative relationship with your manager. 

## Context (optional)
Chapter 2 argues that our current educational systems teaches behavior that is counterproductive in a professional business setting. The Game of School describes how students are conditioned to show their work as proof they have not cheated and often how outside collaboration is condemned for individual work. This hindering in professional setting as collaboration, even on topics unknown to the individual is paramount.
