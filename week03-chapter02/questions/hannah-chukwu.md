# Week 3 Question - Chapter 2: Giving Good-Enough Answers

**Student:** Hannah Chukwu
**Date:** February 5, 2026

## Question

Chapter 2 emphasizes the importance of providing "good-enough" answers quickly to build trust with managers. However, in software engineering, incomplete or hasty answers can sometimes lead to architectural decisions that are costly to reverse later. How do you balance the need to respond promptly with "good-enough" answers against the risk of committing to technical approaches that may create significant refactoring work down the line? Are there specific types of questions where a "good-enough" answer is more appropriate than others?

## Context (optional)

In technical roles, managers often ask questions about system design, technology choices, or implementation approaches. While providing quick feedback builds rapport, premature commitments to certain technical directions (like choosing a database, framework, or architecture pattern) can have long-lasting implications that affect the entire team's productivity.
